# PyTorch for Deep Learning - Personal Follow-Along Notes

Notes + homework follow-along for [mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke)'s PyTorch class.

This repository contains my personal chapter-by-chapter follow-along work for the course.

## Original Course Attribution
The original course material and core teaching structure are from Daniel Bourke's PyTorch course/repository:
- Course repo: https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning

I do not claim the original course content as my own. This repo is my personal learning implementation, notes, and homework-style practice built while following that material.

## Repository Layout
Each numbered folder maps to a chapter/topic from the learning sequence:

- `1 Getting Started`
- `2 WorkFlow`
- `3 Classifcation`
- `4 Vision`
- `5 Custom Datasets`
- `6 Modularizing`
- `7 Transfer_Learning`
- `8 Experiment_Tracking`
- `9 Paper_Replication`
- `10 Model_Deployment`
- `11 Pytorch 2.0`


## Environment Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Notes
- Most chapter content is in notebooks (`.ipynb`) and supporting Python modules.
- Some chapters include data/model artifacts for experimentation and deployment demos.
- If you prefer a lightweight repo, keep large data/model files out of version control and download/regenerate locally.


## End Note
This project is an older series of homework-style follow-along exercises accumulated over time.

This `README.md` was created/cleaned up by Codex specifically to improve repository organization and publish-readiness. That Codex attribution applies to this README file only.
